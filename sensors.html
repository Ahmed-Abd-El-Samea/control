                        <p>The toy car will follow a moving light source in the directions: forward, right, and left. And to do this mission, 3 light sensors “LDRs” are used- one for each direction as shown in fig.1 . The car will move when the light intensity is greater than normal lighting and, less than a certain value to avoid hitting the light source when it stops.</p>

                        <h2>2 - Smoke Sensor Circuit <small>by anas gamal</small> </h2>
                        <p>-In this project, we will go over how to build a smoke sensor circuit with an arduino board.</p>
                        <p>-The smoke sensor we will use is the MQ-2. This is a sensor that is not only sensitive to smoke, but also to flammable gas.</p>
                        <p>-The MQ-2 smoke sensor reports smoke by the voltage level that it outputs. The more smoke there is, the greater the voltage that it outputs. Conversely, the less smoke that it is exposed to, the less voltage it outputs.</p>
                        <p>-The MQ-2 also has a built-in potentiometer to adjust the sensitivity to smoke. By adjusting the potentiometer, you can change how sensitive it is to smoke, so it's a form of calibrating it to adjust how much voltage it will put out in relation to the smoke it is exposed to.</p>
                        <p>-We will wire the MQ-2 to an arduino so that the arduino can read the amount of voltage output by the sensor and sound a buzzer if the sensor outputs a voltage above a certain threshold. This way, we will know that the sensor is detecting smoke and we will sound a buzzer alerting a person such as a homeowner to this fact.</p>
                        <p>-Components Needed for Arduino Smoke Sensor Circuit</p>
                        <p>-MQ-2 Smoke Sensor Arduino board Buzzer</p>
                        <p>-The MQ-2 can be obtained very cheaply, just a few bucks. A good place to look for it is on ebay, which always has auctions on them for the $2-$3 range.</p>
                        <p>-Important, it is recommended that you do not obtain the standalone sensor but the whole MQ-2 board. This is because if you buy the standalone sensor, you will have to finish building the whole schematic before you can connect it to the arduino. So that less work is required for integrating this with the arduino, it is recommended that you buy the complete MQ-2 sensor circuit. This you can see below.</p>
                        <p>-If you buy the complete board, there are 3 leads which need to be connected.</p>
                        <p>-MQ-2-smoke-sensor-pinout, The 3 leads are Output, Vcc, and GND, It's very basic.</p>
                        <p>-The gas sensor needs about 5 volts of power in order to operate. This is done by connecting 5 volts to Vcc and GND.</p>
                        <p>-The Output pin gives out the voltage reading, which is proportional to the amount of smoke that the sensor is exposed to. Again, a high voltage output means the sensor is exposed to a lot of smoke. A low or 0 voltage output means the sensor is exposed to either little or no smoke.</p>

                        <h3>Description:</h3>
                        <p>The basic concept of an Infrared obstacle avoidance sensor is to transmit an infrared signal, this infrared signal bounces from the surface of an object and the signal is received at the infrared receiver.</p>
                        <p>Active infrared sensors consist of two elements: infrared source and infrared detector. Infrared sources include a LED or infrared laser diode. Infrared detectors include photodiodes or phototransistors. The energy emitted by the infrared source is reflected by an object and falls on the infrared detector.</p>
                        <h3>IR Transmitter</h3>
                        <p>Infrared Transmitter is a light emitting diode (LED) which emits infrared radiations. Hence, they are called IR LED’s. Even though an IR LED looks like a normal LED, the radiation emitted by it is invisible to the human eye.</p>
                        <p>The picture of a typical Infrared LED is shown</p>
                        <h3>IR Receiver</h3>
                        <p>nfrared receivers are also called as infrared sensors as they detect the radiation from an IR transmitter. IR receivers come in the form of photodiodes and phototransistors. Infrared Photodiodes are different from normal photo diodes as they detect only infrared radiation. The picture of a typical IR receiver or a photodiode is shown</p>

                        <p>-i.e. The infrared receiver measures the amount of infrared radiation that is reflected. If the reflected amount of light reaches above a certain threshold that means that light was reflected and so the signal pin is triggered. (goes from HIGH to LOW)</p>

                    <h3>Steps and Connection:</h3>
                    <p>- Connecting the DC motor to the fan</p>
                    <p>Using the H bridge to derive the DC motor by connecting Pin(2) of the H bridge to the output of the Arduino board</p>
                    <p>- We'll use the motor in pnly one direction</p>
                    <p>- Connect the motor wires to pins number 3 and 6</p>
                    <p>- Using the code given in sensor number 3, we're calculating the tempreture using the tempreture sensor (Connected to pin A5 in the arduino board)  </p>
                    <p>- If the tempreture calculated is more than 40 degree the output of the Arduino is high, So, the fan turns on</p>

                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>- A PIR sensor (passive infrared sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures IR(infrared) light radiating from objects in its range(approximately 110 degrees).</p>
                        <p>- The PIR sensor has two slots in it, When the sensor is idle, both slots detect the same amount of IR, the ambient amount radiated from the room or walls or outdoors. When a warm body like a human or animal passes by, it first intercepts one half of the PIR sensor, which causes a positive differential change between the two halves. When the warm body leaves the sensing area, the reverse happens, whereby the sensor generates a negative differential change. These change pulses are what is detected.</p>
                        <p>- The use of a lens is to extend the field of view of the sensor.</p>

                        <p>- As long as there’s no motion a red led is on, If motion is detected the car stops, alarm goes on to notify the passer-by and the red led is off.</p>

                            <li>Sensor takes from 10 to 60 seconds to calibrate itself at the beginning.</li>
                            <li>There are to potentiometers, one is responsible for sensitivity (more sensitive means long range==about 7 meters and low sensitivity means more accuracy for low rang==about 3 meters).</li>
                            <li>The second potentiometer is to adjust the time delay(the time of HIGH state after detecting an object).</li>
                            <li>The jumper is used to adjust the sensor on one of tow modes(H &L).</li>
